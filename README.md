# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

The purpose of this project is to perform code refactoring to make the HTML and CSS of the Horiseon website more accessible. We aimed to accomplish this by replacing non-semantic elements with semantic html and cleaning up the CSS stylesheet, as well as adding comments, to make it more accessible.
